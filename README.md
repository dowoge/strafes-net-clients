# strafes-net-clients
Generated clients via the Swagger UI Editor for the StrafesNET API; https://api.strafes.net/

This does not contain all of the supported langauges in the Swagger UI generated clients. For more languages, go to https://editor.swagger.io/.

To generate your own client, go to https://api.strafes.net/documentation.yaml, copy, and paste into the editor.

If you'd like a langauge addition into the repository, file an issue, please only do this if you find it relevant (as in, generating clients for a language not most people know AND not using it once added).
